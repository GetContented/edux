# EduX

EduX is Company X's new app for student education. Students complete lessons and their progress is recorded. Each lesson has 3 parts - 1, 2 and 3. There are 100 lessons in total.


## Set up

This is a reasonably standard Rails application in terms of set up. We use `rbenv` to manage ruby versions. Install `bundler` if you haven't already, then then `bundle install` to install all the required gems. Use `rake test` or `bundle exec guard` to run the tests.
