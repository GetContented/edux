# EduX Requirements

EduX is Company X's new app for student education. Students complete lessons and their progress is recorded. Each lesson has 3 parts - 1, 2 and 3. There are 100 lessons in total.

## PART 1

Generate a rails app that persists students and their progress.

Define routes for:
  - setting a student's progress - progress should consist of a lesson and part number.
  - returning a JSON representation of a student and their associated progress.

## PART 2

Teachers have classes containing number of students.

  - Add a teacher model that is related to students
  - Create a reports page for a teacher to view progress all of their students.

## PART 3

Calculating progress

  - add a method for updating student progress - this should verify that the
student is only able to complete the next part number in sequence e.g.

> L1 P1, L1 P2, L1 P3, L2 P1, L2 P2 etc

Please submit your application as a public git repo. Itâ€™d be great to see commits
of how the solution came about. If you have any questions feel free to mail
